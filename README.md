# Debate-Bot


## Description

This was my first project, I built originally in 2020. It's a simple debate chatbot for Discord, and supports various debate formats while messaging people in the Discord server when time is running out! Built with Python and Discord API.


## Usage

No hosting has been set up for this, thus you would need to set up your own server to run this bot.
